# MrCoffeeWebApp-Project1-2

## Project 1
The Mr.Coffee company called on you because it wants to expand its visibility on the internet. They initially wanted to go for a WordPress website but, after giving it some thought, they ask you to create a simple website from scratch.

This simple website will be made of three pages: 

- A home page which will be the homepage; it will present the activity of the Mr.Coffee company,
- An "About Us" page that will introduce the concept and values behind  Mr.Coffee,
- A "Contact Us" page which will display all of Mr.Coffee's contact information (address, email, telephone).

In order to build this project, the design team sent you visuals, which they ask you to respect perfectly.
A beautiful site is good, but a beautiful site that ranks well in search engines is better! Mr.Coffee therefore asks you to apply appropriate SEO principles in your development.

Finally, they want their customers to enjoy a good browsing experience from any device. They therefore ask you to ensure that the site is responsive and has a suitable presentation on mobile, tablet and desktop.

## Project 2

The Mr.Coffee company is very satisfied with your work and would like to call on you again to expand its website a little.

It wishes to modify the "Contact" page to insert a contact form in order to better treat the requests of its prospects. To do this, you will use a programming language that you already know: JavaScript. 

To make the website more dynamic, the company wants you to set up a pop-up to indicate to the user that their message has been sent. The design team will send you new mock-ups for the visuals of the form and the pop-up. The pop-up must be developed in HTML and CSS, and you must use JavaScript to "display" and "close" the pop-up.
