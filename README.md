# Project 1
The Mr.Coffee company called on you because it wants to expand its visibility on the internet. They initially wanted to go for a WordPress website but, after giving it some thought, they ask you to create a simple website from scratch.
This simple website will be made of three pages: 
A home page which will be the homepage; it will present the activity of the Mr.Coffee company,
An "About Us" page that will introduce the concept and values behind  Mr.Coffee,
A "Contact Us" page which will display all of Mr.Coffee's contact information (address, email, telephone).
In order to build this project, the design team sent you visuals, which they ask you to respect perfectly.
A beautiful site is good, but a beautiful site that ranks well in search engines is better! Mr.Coffee therefore asks you to apply appropriate SEO principles in your development.
Finally, they want their customers to enjoy a good browsing experience from any device. They therefore ask you to ensure that the site is responsive and has a suitable presentation on mobile, tablet and desktop.

# Project 2

The Mr.Coffee company is very satisfied with your work and would like to call on you again to expand its website a little.
It wishes to modify the "Contact" page to insert a contact form in order to better treat the requests of its prospects. To do this, you will use a programming language that you already know: JavaScript. 
To make the website more dynamic, the company wants you to set up a pop-up to indicate to the user that their message has been sent. The design team will send you new mock-ups for the visuals of the form and the pop-up. The pop-up must be developed in HTML and CSS, and you must use JavaScript to "display" and "close" the pop-up.

# Project 3

After your successful work on its showcase site, the Mr.Coffee company would like to put your skills to the service of its internal organisation. They ask you to develop a schedule management website for its teams.
The company first asks you to create a small prototype, which it will present to its teams to assess whether such a website could be useful to them.
For this project, you will have to store data and display it in a browser. To do this, you will discover databases with MySQL and make a small web application.
The prototype will be very simple and will have only two pages: a page to create a schedule, and a page to display all existing schedules.
The M.Coffee company doesn't give you any visual constraints but asks you to make something visually clean and readable.

# Project 4

The Mr.Coffee company presented your prototype to its teams, who are enthusiastic and confirm the usefulness of a website for their schedules. The company therefore commissions you to go beyond the prototype and make a second version of the application, with user accounts and authentication.
You will again use Express and MySQL to build the application, but this time you will need to create an account and login system.
The site will be very simple with few pages. It will be "divided" into two types of pages: pages only accessible to registered users, and login/registration pages.
Employees ("users") will be able to create an account for themselves on the site. Once their account has been created, each employee will be able to log in to create their own schedules and consult all existing schedules.
The entry point to the site will be a login page. Beware, accessing other pages (directly via the url for example) must be strictly impossible for unregistered users. If a user tries to display a page without being connected, you must redirect him to the login page. 
When logged in, users will access a home page that displays all existing schedules. From there, the user can view the profile and schedules of a particular employee or add their own schedules.
Mr.Coffee does not give you any visual constraints but asks you to do something visually clean and readable. To help you, it sends you a site map to respect.
